              <p>
                For the first six months of my tenure here at Houston Community College, much time has been spent in exploration.  With six colleges, nearly 70,000 students and 3.4 million square feet of space, there are no limits to the opportunities that lie ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each conversation brings a unique perspective.   From all of these ideas, HCC is moving to develop and strengthen innovative partnerships with business, industry, the community, and other educational institutions.  We are taking action on projects and programs that better position HCC to meet the workforce demands of tomorrow.  The results are producing additional pathways for student success.
              </p>
              <p>
                As HCC positions itself to become a global leader in workforce training and education in the 21st Century, the transformation will continue.   I hope you will consider reaching out to HCC to partner in the opportunities we can explore together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me know how Houston Community College can be of assistance.

                Houston Community College is a “center of excellence,” training workforce-ready candidates to earn the credentials they need to fill jobs that are readily available. This is why HCC supports the Greater Houston Partnership (GHP) initiative UpSkill Houston, an industry-led action plan that addresses the growing need for skilled workers in Houston and training them for tomorrow’s jobs.

                HCC offers short-term certificate programs and associate degrees to support the demands of the major industry sectors of the region and Houston’s growing economy. From oil and gas to manufacturing, healthcare, construction, maritime and petrochemical, HCC’s established programs, convenient locations and affordability provide easy access to in-demand training for skilled workers.

                The goals of UpSkill Houston include raising awareness among potential workers and improving the quality of applicants through skills training and education. The initiative focuses on middle-skills occupations that require employee candidates to have more than a high school diploma, but do not require a four-year degree.

                  <p class='lead'>
                    Hundreds of middle school students will get the chance to become real rocket scientists through a partnership with Houston Community College and the Houston Rockets. The “Rockets Science” program will allow students to build their own rockets then launch them into “outer space” from an HCC location.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Up to 40 students from 10 Houston area middle schools will be chosen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA is providing the teaching materials and Space Center Houston is involved in hosting an event for participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the 40 students, any student of any age may take advantage of the curriculum that will be in the Rockets-hosted portal that will have the instructional information for anyone who may want to build a rocket at home. 
                    This will be a four-week course to begin in February 2015 and will include a tour of Space Center Houston and launch day at HCC. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Final details are being worked out, but this is a great opportunity for middle school students within our service area and beyond. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Houston Rockets are hopeful this partnership is something that can be shared as a best practice within the NBA. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the Houston Rockets are creating six in-game STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) related videos to be displayed during home games, using players, coaches and office staff to give game attendees an opportunity to learn how much fun a career in STEM can be. 
                    Videos will include the science behind a human jump – both vertical and broad jump, muscles responsible, techniques, an analysis of hang time, and a second one that will calculate the amount of time a ball is in the shooter’s hand, mapping the angles of the catch and shoot, and an in-depth look at the math, geometry and timing behind the shot. Other topics will include statistics of basketball, the nutrition involved to support an NBA player and others.

              <p>
                The HCC New Mathways Program is being launched to allow students to get on the road to success in college math much more quickly. In the past, students may have been bogged down with several courses in developmental math that didn’t count for college credit, and spent additional time and money, now many students will be able to transition with only one pre-requisite math course aligned with their field of study.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The program has been a collaborative effort between the HCC Mathematics Program and The Charles A. Dana Center at UT Austin.  It is based on four fundamental principles:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>1. Multiple pathways with challenging mathematics content geared to a student’s specific field of study.</li>
                <li>2. Accelerating students more quickly to a college-level math course.</li>
                <li>3. Specific and relevant strategies to help students develop skills as learners.</li>
                <li>4. Curriculum design based on proven practices in teaching and learning.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                Student success and accelerating a student’s progress through a college education: that’s what this New Mathways Program is all about,” said Dr. Stephen Levey, Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Instruction at HCC.  “HCC is committed to educating students who will graduate prepared for their chosen careers.  By following a Mathway more closely aligned with their field of study, each student will be completing courses that tie more directly to what will be needed in their future careers.”

                  <p>
                    There’s growing interest in expanding the Futures Academy at Houston Community College. The program is a dual-credit partnership between HCC and the Houston Independent School District (HISD) that allows high school students to take HCC classes and earn college credits while attending high school.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This summer, the Futures Academy graduated its first cohort of students from five Houston area high schools. The 60 students received their Associates in Applied Sciences degrees from HCC, months after they received their high school diplomas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal of the Futures Academy is to provide access for college-ready high school students to career pathways leading to in-demand employment opportunities with good wages. Many students represent first generation college students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Futures Academy students hail from Booker T. Washington, Furr, Kashmere, Scarborough, and Sterling. They received degrees in Manufacturing Engineering Technology, Engineering Technology-Renewable & Sustainable Energy, Process Technology, Network & Computer Systems Administration, and Logistics & Global Supply Chain Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most Futures Academy students in the first graduating class entered the program with deficiencies in reading, writing and math skills. In addition to completing their high school and HCC requirements, students were provided tutoring support by both institutions to qualify and to be better prepared for the higher level coursework connected to their degree plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Throughout this program I’ve learned that I’m able to accomplish things that I didn’t think I would be able to do,” said Jose Moreno, graduate of the Futures Academy program at Sterling High School. “I never gave up. I always pushed myself through to finish the task.”

          The Houston Community College Foundation has awarded thousands of scholarships to deserving HCC students. For the fall semester alone, nearly 550 students were given scholarships to help them continue on their path to the future. This was all made possible through the generosity of our expanding group of business and community donors who understand the need to support the developing workforce. The fundraising efforts continue to expand with the ultimate goal of building a scholarship endowment sufficient to award a scholarship to all HCC credit-hour students who qualify for assistance as they begin their college career.

                    Members of the Sembradores de Amistad  announced a permanently endowed scholarship for the benefit of Hispanic and low-income students pursuing an education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) at HCC. Since 2007, the Sembradores de Amistad has provided scholarship funds for HCC students, but this donation provides a gift that will live in perpetuity. Their $60,000 was matched with other funds, and an additional $9,000 was raised by community leaders to support the efforts of the group, resulting in a total endowed scholarship of $138,000.

          Houston Community College continues its commitment to growth and student success. The Board of Trustees approved all 14 bond projects in the HCC $425 million Groundbreaker Bond Program as promised to the voters and construction plans are being developed that will enhance all six HCC colleges.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The capital improvement project will add 1 million square feet to the already existing 3.4 million square feet of space across the entire district. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Bond projects currently underway include: improvements to the Alief Campus, West Houston Institute, adding new multi-use parking garages to the West Loop and Northline Campuses, creating new Workforce Buildings at Brays Oaks, Stafford, Eastside, Central South and North Forest Campuses, building a new Center for Entrepreneurship, Technology and Health (CETH) at the Missouri City Campus, creating a new STEM facility at the Felix Fraga Campus, a new site for Northeast College in Acres Homes, building renovations at HCC Central, and a new tower at Coleman College of Health Sciences.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Our bond program aims to make a positive difference in the small business community, with 35 percent of overall construction work going to SBEs,” said Dr. Cesar Maldonado, chancellor. “Moreover, 85-90 percent of program funds will be spent at the sub-contractor level versus 10-15 percent at the CMAR level.”
        </p>
        
        <p class='pad-bottom-lg'>
          To help meet that 35% goal, HCC and Jacobs Program Management hosted 3 small business enterprise networking events which allowed small business subcontractors to meet the CMARs in charge of construction projects.

                    Students who graduate from Houston Community College with an Associate Degree in Nursing are having a hard time finding employment in their chosen field of study because they don’t have a Bachelors of Science in Nursing. Hospitals will soon require 80% of bedside nurses to have a BSN to work in any Magnet Status hospital.  With the steady growth of the Texas Medical Center, expansion is particularly critical in the field of nursing.

                    In these days of confidential patient information being protected, the role of a Medical Scribe is more important than ever. Students are trained as medical information managers who specialize in charting physician-patient encounters in real-time. In a professional role, medical scribes interact and collaborate with other members of the health care team, but serve as the right hand to the physician. Similar to the medical transcriptionist, the medical scribe provides another career pathway or stepping stone to the health care system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Medical Scribe Program at HCC Coleman College is approved by the American College of Medical Scribe Specialists (AMCSS). In six months, students will learn the fundamentals of the scribe field including medical terminology, anatomy & physiology, electronic health records, medical insurance, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as law & ethics for the health professions. Students are trained in both the classroom and in the clinical area to document the history, chief complaint, physical exam, assessments and procedures dictated by the provider during real-time charting.

            The Office of Finance and Planning has worked diligently on preparing a budget for the 2014 – 2015 academic year that positions the college for both meaningful growth and success. As the door opens to 2015, HCC will begin formulating a 5-year strategic plan that will be supported by reorganization across the district that will be the result of meetings with faculty, students, administrators and the community.  During the past six months enrollment has grown, and all employees (including adjunct faculty) have received a salary increase. The Board of Trustees has earmarked $1 million in scholarships to support student success, while continually examining data to make the best strategic decisions for years to come. Below are some of the accomplishments to date and some of the plans for the future.
